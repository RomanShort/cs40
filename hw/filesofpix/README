Roman Short (rshort02) and Henry Lee (jelee02)

We spent many hours in Cummings, with help from several TAs. Alec (hope that's
spelled correctly) was a huge help with some valgrind issues. 

We beleive everything is correctly implemented. We tested with all provided 
pgm files and used valgrind on each. Our expansion of the array in readaline
seems to behave as expected, and we do not know of any errors at this time. 

A note on structure: Overall program flow is as follows. 
Program reads lines using readaline until EOF. Until the correct key
is found, a Hanson table is used to add a key as the character
array and a value as a Hanson sequence of digits. Once the correct key
is found with Table_get, the Hanson table is no longer used. 
Then we use strcmp with the correct_key, which is now known, and 
the current filler (array of injected characters for current line)
and add the sequence of digits created from that line to an overarching
Hanson sequence of sequences if the correct_key matches filler. 

FixFile handles the printing of the P5 PGM, and restoration operates
as a main program that calls restore() from restore.h. We aimed for 
multiple layers of abstraction and tried to keep our code as modularized
and simple to follow as possible.
